# SAE - Sistemas de Armazenamento de Energia (Energy Storage Systems)
ISEL\DEEEA\MEE


 ## Pluto notebooks repository of SAE

This repository contains notebooks on energy storage systems (related parts: Supercaps and Secondary Batteries) in scientific computing tool [*Julia*](https://julialang.org/), using [*Pluto*](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).  
**_Pluto_** is an interactive computing environment for the _Julia_ programming language that uses a web browser (recommended: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome). It allows combining _Julia_ code and computational results with text, mathematical expressions, images, etc., in an interconnected and interactive way with the user. Updating a piece of code automatically reruns all the pieces affected by that change.

## Installation of _Julia_ and _Pluto_
- video and written versions to install _Julia_ and _Pluto_: [First-time setup: Install Julia & Pluto](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/)
- opinion article: [First Steps #5: Pluto.jl ðŸŽˆ](https://www.juliafordatascience.com/first-steps-5-pluto/)

## Additional information
### _Why Julia?_  
- open-source scientific computing language 
- easy adoption, especially for those who know MATLAB: see the comparison between [MATLAB _vs._ Python _vs._ Julia](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/)
- opinion article: [10 Reasons Why You Should Learn Julia](https://blog.goodaudience.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-learn-julia-d786ac29c6ca)

### _Why Pluto?_  
-  allows literate and reactive programming. [Pluto's presentation video, at the JuliaCon 2020 conference, July 2020. Duration: 24min.](https://youtu.be/IAF8DjrQSSk)
- *Pluto* one year later. [JuliaCon 2021 Conference, July 2021. Duration: 27min.](https://youtu.be/HiI4jgDyDhY)
- **_Pluto notebooks_** are *Julia* files, which you can then import as if you had been programming in a regular editor all along or in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Atom...
